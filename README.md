# Face-Mask-Detector
A real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not.   The trend of wearing face masks in public is rising due to the COVID- 19 coronavirus epidemic all over the world. Before Covid-19, People used to wear masks to protect their health from air pollution. While other people are self-conscious about their looks, they hide their emotions from the public by hiding their faces. Scientists proved that wearing face masks work on impeding COVID-19 transmission. COVID19 (known as coronavirus) is the latest epidemic virus that hit human health in the last century. In 2020, the rapid spreading of COVID-19 has forced the World Health Organization to declare COVID- 19 as a global pandemic. More than 152,133,533 were infected by COVID-19 in less than 18 months across 188 countries. The virus spreads through close contact and in crowded and overcrowded areas.  As the country starts going through various stages of reopening, and currently we are fighting with the 2nd wave of covid-19 face masks have become an important element of our daily lives. Wearing face masks  will be required in order to socialize or conduct business. So I decided to create an  application using Machine Learning that utilizes a camera to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not.
